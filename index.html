  <h1>Countries with the Most Terrorist Attacks, 2000-2014</h1>

  <p>Terrorist attacks have increased by 8000% since the 1970s due to an increase in the scale of the attacks and ideology behind the movements. From 1970 until 1995, suicide attacks were non-existent. Modern terrorist groups are more likely to use Medieval practices outlined in religious texts than their predecessors, making for violence that had rarely been seen in the past twenty years. Modern terrorists are also no longer restricted to national borders as they were in Latin America in the 80s and 90s. Islamic Extremists' cells expand well beyond their headquarters, expanding terror along the entire Middle East.</p>
