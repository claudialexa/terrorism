Nikolic claimed he also received a letter similar to that of Anthony Cikoja, who was assassinated a week earlier for the same reasons (197809280007).  Nikolic said the letter was written in Croatian dialect, demanding money. It is unknown whether there were any injuries or fatalities as a result of the bombing.",,1,0,7,Facility/Infrastructure Attack,1,Business,Otpor,"Nikolic was sent a letter demanding he contribute money to the Croatian nationalist cause, similar to the assassination case of Anthony Cikoja.",-99,-99,8,Incendiary,,,,,,,1,3,Minor (likely < $1 million),"It is unclear whether the letter may have been sent by the Yugoslav secret police in efforts to discredit the Croatian separatist movement, as some American-Croatian community leaders believe to be the case. This incident is linked to the assassination of Anthony Cikoja, by suspected Croatian nationalists after he refused to pay $5,000 per the nationalists' request in a threatening letter (197809280007) and the assassination of Krizan Brkic, an American of Croatian descent in California (197811220002), who had also received a threatening letter similar to that of Cikoja.  In June of 1981, eight men were arrested and indicted on charges of racketeering and extortion, including the murders of Cikoja and Brkic, and several arsons.  According to the indictments, the men were members of a Croatian organization called ""Otpor,"" or Croatian National Resistance group that used terror and violence to extort money from individuals of Croatian origin living in the United States. A ninth man was later arrested and indicted as an associate of the other eight responsible for the abovementioned incidents. Those indicted included Mile Markic (the alleged leader of Otpor in the U.S.), Mile Boban (the alleged president of Otpor in North America), Ante Ljubas, Andjelko Jakic (former vice president of the New York chapter of the group), Ivan Misetic (former vice president of the Chicago chapter),  Vinko Logarusic (leader of the Cleveland chapter), Ranko Primorac (leader of the Los Angeles chapter), Miro Biosic (treasurer of the L.A. chapter), and Drago Sudar (the associate of the other eight members of the group).
